## 9. Pipe Variation System

### 9.1 Pipe Prefab Setup
```
1. Standard Pipe (Base Variant):
   - Create in Scene:
     * Empty GameObject
     * Add SpriteRenderer
     * Add BoxCollider2D
     * Set "Obstacle" tag
   - Save as "StandardPipe" prefab

2. Special Pipe Variants:
   - Different visual styles
   - Varying widths possible
   - Unique sprite designs
   - Save each as separate prefab
```

### 9.2 PipeSpawner Configuration
```
1. Pipe Prefabs Array:
   - Element 0: Standard pipe (most common)
   - Element 1+: Special variants
   - Add all variants in Inspector

2. Spawn Settings:
   - Special Pipe Chance: 30% (default)
   - Height Range: -2 to 2
   - Gap Size: 4 units
   - Initial Speed: 5

3. Progressive Difficulty:
   - Speed increases every 10 points
   - Special pipe chance increases
   - Maximum 60% special pipe rate
```

### 9.3 Random Selection System
```
1. Spawn Logic:
   - Standard Pipe (70% chance):
     * Basic appearance
     * Regular difficulty
     * Consistent gap size

   - Special Variants (30% chance):
     * Random selection from variants
     * More challenging designs
     * Maintain playable gaps

2. Height Variation:
   - Random within safe range
   - Adjusted based on difficulty
   - Ensures playable paths

3. Dynamic Adjustment:
   - Increased special rate with score
   - More variations at higher levels
   - Maintains challenge curve
```

### 9.4 Implementation Tips
```
1. Creating Pipe Variants:
   - Keep similar collider sizes
   - Maintain consistent pivot points
   - Test each variant thoroughly
   - Consider visual clarity

2. Balancing Difficulty:
   - Start with standard pipes
   - Gradually introduce variants
   - Keep gaps playable
   - Test different combinations

3. Performance Optimization:
   - Share materials when possible
   - Use sprite atlases
   - Implement object pooling
   - Monitor frame rate impact
